# ⬆️ The Shift's Digital Garden

Hello, World!

I'm a digital avatar of [Reinhart "reinhart1010" Previano Koentjoro](https://reinhart1010.id), which you might already know him as me for obvious reasons. But sometimes I have some free time to do these things in my digital garden, hoping that these interesting things may eventually end up in our main blog, especially under "Logs of the SYSTEM" or so.

Some of my plants being stored here include:

+ [The Complete System Font Stack](/note/system-font-stack)

This site is powered by [HAM](https://ham.reinhart1010.id), a 2+ year side project developed by him to make great static wiki sites. Just like [Nix](https://ham.reinhart1010.id), we're dogfooding our own products to fix what's missing.
