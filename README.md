Hello, World!

This repository will house our official definition, manifesto, and some attributes for our organization, The Shift.

## What

[Shift means changed, change, and changing others](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/shift). It's also [that key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shift_key) you always pressed to write capital letters without the COMICAL DANGERS OF THE cAPS lOCK.

That said, **The Shifts** is the name of our organization, community, and ourselves. Everyone who joins The Shifts is, indeed, also called as a Shift.

We are real superheroes with normal powers, and we believe our normal powers *are* our superpowers. We're augmented with the powers of the Holy Spirit to live, survive, and become the change for our fragile world.

There are two main types of Shift, based on their skills:

+ **Full Shifts** are proficient digital creators and computer masters. We believe that knowing how computers work is the key of mastering the digital world.
+ **Shiftlings** are those willing to Shift but haven't have much knowledge and experience to become a full Shift.

## But seriously, who are you?

We're the ones who usually wear our infamous ⬆️-on-👕 shirt, with our names and numbers written on the back. We often conceal our face with a blue 🔮 wearing the symbols `(>_)`, aka. the universally recognized symbol of the [Command Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) / [Terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_terminal).



## Why

We're definitely lacking impactful tech collectives who love and serve God, whose His son Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit was sent to Earth to save us from our deadly sins.

In most Indonesian churches, "tech ministry" is no different than "multimedia ministry". Yeah, like those who handle PowerPoint slides and EasyWorship stuff, photography, YouTube channel management, *et cetera*.

In the rising age of humans who lost their minds inside video games and metaverses, blinded themselves into sexy furries and virtual anime characters, worship computer algorithms, and even claiming themselves capable to shift between realities over TikTok, **churches need to do more to save more lives.**

So here we are. We act accordingly in the **real, spiritual, fantasy, and digital worlds** to **win the multiverse for Jesus Christ**. We also refer these worlds as the four **Realms of Action** (RoAs).

Well, if you don't believe that the multiverse exists, we believe in that, too 😄. However, it's still our mission to bring back the lost sheeps from the so-called "multiverse" back to the God of this world.

And of course, you can't change others if you don't change yourself. That's why here I declare that I'm excited to be a Shift for you.

## The Alignment

The Alignment of the Shift, simply known as **The Alignment**, is our manifesto. You can read the full version of The Alignment here.

We wrote The Alignment as an effort to canonize our beliefs in God, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit, as our founders' churches came from Pentecostal, apostolic and prophetic backgrounds. Not every churches and Christian organizations in this world have the same beliefs in Christianity, and this is why we will test their creeds and manifestos against The Alignment before allowing them to partner with us.

## What we do

We master and embrace technology to:

1. Build and become the backbone of modern church pioneering and growth
2. Guard people from the dangers of fantasy and digital Realms of Action
3. Prove the world that the art of technology is a gift from God, and we can use technology to praise, worship, and become sustainable blessings of all people.

## Don't just be a fan. Be.

If you're blessed by our amazing works, the best way to support us is well, **to become us**. There's always a Shift waiting for you to come and support you to become one of us.

Even if you're not ready enough to be a full Shift, we are open for Shiftlings like you to grow and empower each other, becoming the full Shift of your future.

After all, it's okay to be a fanshift. But whatever you do as a Shift, please do it for the love of God, not your favorite Shift.
