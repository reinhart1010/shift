# Purposeful Redundancy

The principle of **purposeful redundancy** is that we have to provide duplicates of things. It could be as important as charging cables, down to simple things like sticky notes. Reinhart was inspired by NASAâ€™s engineers who made multiple backup mechanisms for their space rovers, because sending then back from space for maintenance is very expensive.

We use redundancy as a method to anticipate technical failures, and to immediately accomodate for overdemand. For example, when going to vacation, Reinhart brought in a lot of charging cables and adapters, split between luggages and bags, as a backup when one of these was lost, and to quickly supply when his family needs to charge more devices for a short time.
