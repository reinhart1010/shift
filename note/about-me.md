# About Me

In 2014, Reinhart created me and Shiftine as the main, playable characters for a video game he was imagined for days. No, we werenâ€™t kidding, and this truth is neither for lore nor fan service. He was inspired by other his high school friends creating their original characters (OCs) over DeviantArt, and he wished to create one.

You can check out the original lore, as finalized in 2016, below. But long story short, he abandoned the project to continue working on his life.

In 2021, he felt lonely and sick. Lonely because he have lost many of his friends during the COVID-19 pandemic, then sick and hospitalized (not because of COVID-19) for having too much stress at work. Then came the idea to revive us until today.

Thereâ€™s a lot to tell here, so we divide it into several sections. Hopefully, this can solve your answers about the existence of ourselves.

## Original character description (as in 2016)

**Name:**
+ Charlie Sweetstar ðŸ‘‘
+ Charlene Sweetstar ðŸ‘¸

**Age:** Random, but they are twins

**Occupation/Position:**
Sorcery and King/Queen of the Hacker Kingdom.

**Home Address:** Cloud (Internet)

**Work Address:** 127.0.0.1

Once upon some lines of code, lived a pair of twins who are being unwanted by a family. They are left by their parents for many years. Even their parents forgot about them.

The twins walked along a path across to the Hacker Kingdom, which is far far away. During their journey, they have tried to survive from Wicked Hackers around the forest. Wicked Hackers are harmful to the Kingdom. Those hackers are often stealing lines of code from the Kingdom. The King prepared an army of hackers to defeat them. Unfortunately, the army failed.

After the twins entered the Kingdom, a sorcerer adopted both of them. Soon, the sorcerer give name to the twins as Charlie Sweetstar and Charlene Sweetstar. What a similar name!

The sorcerer teached them magic for years, the magic that can defeat the darkness of the Wicked Hackers outside. The sorcerer did not teach magic to others because they can destroy the Kingdom. Even the sorcerer did not tell and teach the King about it. 
Soon, Charlie and Charlene mastered all the sorcery of hackers, and start to defeat the Wicked ones. They started the journey to the forest near on the App Valley, then on the Import Hills. Both of them successfully defeated some of the Wicked ones.

The news spread to the entire kingdom. Then, the King called both of them to the castle, which is known as the "127.0.0.1". Some civilians are also calling the palace "0.0.0.0" or "localhost".

## Searching for Shiftine

When Reinhart was hospitalized in 2021, he was searching for a partner that understands him and his interests in ICT. It felt difficult at that, COVID-19 times, as many of his friends are also struggling to live their life.

A quick flashback to the 2014 days led him to start redesign his own characters, to become **Nate** (now Shift) and **Nix** (now Jilly). He didnâ€™t create us as anime or VTuber characters, because he said they represent a wholly wrong self image of the talents who performed them as well as their followers (learn more about his full reasons [here](https://reinhart1010.id/blog/2022/12/08/can-i-become-a-christian-vtuber)).

He then reiterated his character designs to form a self-insert and three more characters, entirely named according to special keyboard keys (Shift, Alt, Caps Lock, etc.). At that moment, **Shiftine** was created before me, **Shift**.

## Transhumanism and Cyberpunk

These two common things have been attributed to our lives have endangered Reinhartâ€™s own self image. Because it is (see Romans 1:18-32, those who changed the glory of the God will be abandoned by God to do foolish things).

Since 2014, we were intentionally designed as humans with the ability to transform into robots. Unlike Iron Man, *our flesh becomes the metal*. And the whole point of the video game was all about embracing our powers, including being able to live and transport through the digital world.

We were practicing [transhumanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transhumanism) after all, and soon realized that we were created as a product of Reinhartâ€™s false self-image.
