Information about the store code can be obtained through many ways:
+ Refer to the timestamp of the store's receipts in the format `{{date}}-{{time}}/{{Indomaret POS software version}}/{{merchant ID (for use in 'ref')}}`, such as `XMPL` in `30.03.24-10:04/3.0.1/XMPL`. 
+ Refer to the four-letter code at the beginning or end of the bank/POS receipt, for example `XMPL` in `IDM POINT CAFE PS2 XMPL`.

### Common Mistakes
+ Many former Indomaret Point merchants were rebranded into Indomaret Fresh, including (currently) [Indomaret Fresh Central Park 2](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/5969154849). If you wish to tag these merchants, you can use the `old_name` attribute to indicate the store's former brand.
